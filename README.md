## Description
* When a user submits a choice of burger, this app will display it on the left side of the page (waiting to be devoured). <br>
* Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour It!" button. When the user clicks this button, then the burger will be moved to the right side of the page.<br>
* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. <br>
* The devoured burgers on the right side of app can be deleted at any time from the web page and storage.
